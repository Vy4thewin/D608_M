    <h1>Module 6: D3</h1>
    <h2>By Vyanna Hill</h3>

    <h3>Question 1</h3>
    <p> Our task is to create a line graph of the agricultural employment data.</p>
    <p>Using the examples in the Module's folder, we only have to select our Y to be the Argicultural Industry column.</p>
    <p>When we are using external data, <b>Remember to check the data use is recongize as a object of Arrays and not a object.</b></p>
    <p>It is easier to use the AutoType for this dataset as its all the same type </p>
    <div id="Part_1">
        <svg id="Chart_1" style="width:1200px;height:600px;"></svg>
    </div>

    <h3>Question 2</h3>
    <p>The svg graph is currently cut off by its viewport dimensions. The graph is complete but "out of bounds" from the user's view.</p>
    <p>When we use inspect, we can see parts of the svg elements outside the current bounds. Increasing the svg dimensions would put it in view but it will take up more space and be no proportionate</p>
    <p>In order for our pretty steamgraph to be in view, we need to shift the graph up into view. We can use the attribute tranform.translate to change the element's postion on the svg container</p>

        <svg id="Chart_2" style="width:1200px;height:600px;"></svg>
